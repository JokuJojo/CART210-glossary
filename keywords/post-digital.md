## Post-Digital

Post-digital refers to a cultural and artistic movement that emerges after the overwhelming saturation
of digital technology in everyday life. It describes a shift in how society and culture engage with
digital media, where the novelty of digital technologies has worn off, and they are now seamlessly
integrated into daily existence. The term conveys a sense of moving beyond the initial excitement of
new digital tools and entering a phase where the distinction between the digital and the physical has
blurred.[^berry15theory]

In new media, the post-digital condition is reflected in the blending of digital and analog practices.
It emphasizes imperfection, error, and a re-engagement with older media formats. For example, in art
and design, post-digital aesthetics often feature glitches, pixelation, and lo-fi visuals that reject
the hyper-polished perfection typical of earlier digital media. This aesthetic celebrates the organic,
messy qualities that are a byproduct of digital technology, marking a move toward more tactile and 
authentic expressions in media.[^cave13aesthetic]

Post-digital is also connected to contemporary technologies like generative art, where algorithms 
create unpredictable and often imperfect results. The rise of vinyl records and cassette tapes, 
despite the dominance of digital formats, is a paradigmatic example of the post-digital in practice. 
This resurgence highlights the value placed on analog experiences in an otherwise fully digital 
world. [^galloway14culture]

The concept was popularized by media theorist David Berry, who explored its significance in
post-digital culture.He suggests that the post-digital era is when digital technology is everywhere,
and media focuses less on new tech and more on how it affects culture. [^berry15theory]
